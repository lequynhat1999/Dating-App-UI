# System Patterns

**Architecture:** Angular Single-Page Application (SPA)

**Component-Based Structure:** The UI is built using reusable Angular components. Key components include:

- `AppComponent`: Root application component.
- `NavbarComponent`: Handles navigation and user authentication.
- `MemberCardComponent`: Displays member information in listings.
- `MemberEditComponent`: Allows users to edit their profiles.
- `MemberDetailComponent`: Provides detailed views of member profiles.

**Services:** Angular services are used for data handling and business logic.
- `AccountService`: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- `MemberService`: Handles member data and profile operations.

**Design Patterns:**  Likely using common Angular patterns such as:
- Dependency Injection
- Observables for asynchronous operations
- Reactive Forms for form handling
